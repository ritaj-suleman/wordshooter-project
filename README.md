 **Description**  
**Word Shooter** is a 2D game developed in **C++** using the **GLUT library**, where players shoot letters onto a grid to form valid words. The objective is to score as many points as possible by forming words within a time limit of 2 minutes. The game combines quick reflexes with word-forming skills for an engaging experience.

 **Key Features**  
- **Dynamic Collision Detection:** Ensures letters land correctly in grid cells.
- **Scoring System:** Points are calculated based on the length of the formed words.
- **Word Detection Algorithm:** Recognizes words in all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
- **Timer:** Gameplay is limited to 2 minutes for an added challenge.
- **Background Music:** Immersive sounds enhance the gaming experience.

 **How to Play**  
1. **Shooting Letters:** Use the mouse to aim and shoot a letter onto the grid. The letter is launched at an angle towards the grid.
2. **Word Formation:** Align letters on the grid to form valid words. Words can be formed:
   - Horizontally
   - Vertically
   - Diagonally
3. **Timer:** The game runs for 2 minutes, with the timer displayed at the top of the screen.
4. **Scoring:** Points are awarded based on the length of each valid word formed.
